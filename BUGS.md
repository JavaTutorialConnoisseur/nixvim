Bugs
-------------

All bugs in the configuration during work can go here:

- treesitter fucks up during certain injected langs (bash, most commonly in `stylix.nix`)
            - solved stupidly via toggling code injections hmts in `nix.nix` (ugly, but no red paragraph?)

- visual bug: in VSPLIT, sometimes context / depth line segments disappear. I don't use vsplit much so idc

NOT REPRODUCED:

- one time, toggleterm window started persisting in the pypr win? No idea why.
